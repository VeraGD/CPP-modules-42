This repository contains the C++ modules I'm completing in 42. These projects are designed to build a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, memory management, and modern C++ features.

The C++ track at 42 is divided into several modules, each introducing progressively advanced topics. The focus is on understanding core concepts and writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code without relying on external libraries.

# âœ… Completed Modules
- **Module 00** â€“ Basics of C++: I/O streams, std::string, pointers, references

- **Module 01** â€“ Dynamic memory, file I/O, references, pointer arithmetic

- **Module 02** â€“ Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, canonical form (Orthodox Canonical Form)

- **Module 03** â€“ Inheritance, base/derived classes, polymorphism

- **Module 04** â€“ Abstract classes, interfaces, and dynamic polymorphism

- **Module 05** â€“ Introduction to C++ exception handling: try/catch blocks, creating and managing custom exceptions

- **Module 06** â€“ Type casting in C++: static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, and when/how to use each safely
  
- **Module 07** â€“ C++ templates: function and class templates

- **Module 08** â€“ Templated containers, iterators, and algorithms

- **Module 09** â€“ Functional programming tools in C++: function pointers, functors, std::function, and more STL algorithms

# ðŸ”§ How to Use
You can clone this repository and compile each exercise for each module separately. Most folders contain a Makefile to simplify compilation.
```ruby
git clone https://github.com/VeraGD/CPP-modules-42.git
cd cpp_module_XX/ex0X
make
./program
```
